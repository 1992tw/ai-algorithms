### Introduction to AI Ethics

In this section, we explore the fundamental ethical considerations in AI. Core topics include algorithmic bias, data privacy, accountability, and transparency. Students should understand how biases originate and propagate in AI models, the importance of transparency in algorithmic decision-making, and the regulatory frameworks that are evolving to address these challenges.

**Examples:**
- Example: Discuss how facial recognition systems can be biased due to unbalanced training datasets.

### Case Studies in AI Ethics

Analyzing real-world examples helps in understanding the impact of ethical lapses in AI deployment. This section presents case studies where AI led to unintended consequences, such as predictive policing tools exacerbating racial biases and AI systems used in hiring processes displaying gender bias. Students will evaluate what went wrong and how such issues might be mitigated.

**Examples:**
- Case Study: Analyze the COMPAS algorithm used in the U.S. justice system and its implications on fairness and justice.

### Future Directions in AI

The potential future paths of AI, including technological advancements and their implications, are considered here. Trends such as explainable AI, continued improvements in pattern recognition, AI-human collaboration, and AI's role in global challenges like climate change are discussed. Students should be able to critique both optimistic and pessimistic views of AI's future.

**Examples:**
- Example: Discuss the roles of AI in sustainable energy through improved resource allocation and demand prediction.
